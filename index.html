				<p>
					Here are the projects I've completed in the past and the projects I'm currently undertaking. If you are here after reading my CV you've probably read about a few already, so if you want any more information on those projects you're in the right place! 
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<h2>Conversion Toolkit</h2>
				<span class="project-subtitle"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arcticumi.Conversion_Toolkit&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Download</a> - <a href="https://github.com/collis96/Unit-Conversion-Tool" target="_blank">Code</a></span>
				<img src="img/convert-app.PNG" class="project-img" align="left" alt="conversion-toolkit-image">
				<p>
					The Conversion Toolkit mobile application for Android provides users with an easy-to-use "toolkit" for day to day conversions. Whether you are trying to convert Kilometers to Miles, understand the amount of Electronvolts in a Joule or see how many Indian Rupees you can get for 50 British Pounds, Conversion Toolkit can do it all!
				</p>
				<p>
					While making this app, there were many challenges I had to overcome. The currency function proved to be the most challenging, for this to work I needed live data and the application would have to display this live data into something meaningful to the user. To achieve this I used xml parsing which would retrieve the relevant information needed based on user selection. With the information parsed into a linked list the application then extracts the exchange rate value needed and multiplies it with the users input.
				</p>
				<p>
					While it only takes a fraction of a second to download the xml data upon request, I implemented multithreading so the application does not slow down at any point for the user.
				</p>

				<h2>Raycasting Coding Adventure</h2>
				<span class="project-subtitle"><a href="rays.html" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> - <a href="https://github.com/collis96/Raycasting" target="_blank">Code</a></span>
				<img src="img/raycasting.PNG" class="project-img" align="left" alt="raycasting-image">
				<p>
					This is a project I'm still currently working on. Currently the demo is demonstrating the properties of light rays hitting opaque wall objects. I will be adding a user menu and a 3D visuallisation of what the light is hitting at a later date. You can see the progress of it yourself by clicking the Live Demo link on the left.
				</p>
				<p>
					Computer graphics are a fascinating subject that I really want to understand at a deeper level. Working with them is incredibly rewarding when you can see the progress you are making in a very visual way.
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<h2>Simple Calculator</h2>
				<span class="project-subtitle"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arcticumi.calculator&hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Download</a> - <a href="https://github.com/collis96/Calculator" target="_blank">Code</a></span>
				<img src="img/calculator-app.PNG" class="project-img" align="left" alt="calculator-app-image">
				<p>
					This application was a project I set myself as a first venture into Android development. I wanted to create a very easy-to-use calculator with accessiblity in mind. That's why I decided on a basic colour scheme and easy to press large buttons.
