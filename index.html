					Here are the projects I've completed in the past and the projects I'm currently undertaking. If you are here after reading my CV you've probably seen a few already, so if you want any more information on those projects you're in the right place!

					<h2>
						The Game of Life in JavaScript
					</h2>
					<span class="project-subtitle"><a href="../game-of-life/game-of-life.html" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> - <a href="https://github.com/collis96/Game-of-Life" target="_blank">Code</a></span>
					<img src="img/game-of-life.PNG" class="project-img" align="left" alt="game-of-life-image">
					<p>
						This is another coding challenge I set myself, to recreate<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"  target="_blank"> Conway's Game of Life</a> in JavaScript (with a few of my own additional touches).
						The premise of the Game of Life goes as follows, there exists an inital seed of cells on a 2 by 2 grid, and 3 underpinning rules that decide whether each cell will die, reproduce or stay dormant. The board state changes constantly
						because of these 3 simple rules and can create some quite interesting patterns.
					</p>


					<p>
						<u>Fun fact:</u><br>
						<br>
						It has been proven that the game of life is actually a <a href="" target="_blank"> Turing Machine</a>, that is, a machine that can compute anything computable.

					<h2>Conversion Toolkit</h2>
					<span class="project-subtitle"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arcticumi.Conversion_Toolkit&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Download</a> - <a href="https://github.com/collis96/Unit-Conversion-Tool" target="_blank">Code</a></span>
					<img src="img/convert-app.PNG" class="project-img" align="left" alt="conversion-toolkit-image">
					<p>
						The Conversion Toolkit mobile application for Android provides users with an easy-to-use "toolkit" for day to day conversions. Whether you are trying to convert Kilometers to Miles, understand the amount of Electronvolts in a Joule or see how many Indian Rupees you can get for 50 British Pounds, Conversion Toolkit can do it all!
					</p>
					<p>
						While making this app, there were many challenges I had to overcome. The currency function proved to be the most challenging, for this to work I needed live data and the application would have to display this live data into something meaningful to the user. To achieve this I used xml parsing which would retrieve the relevant information needed based on user selection. With the information parsed into a linked list the application then extracts the exchange rate value needed and multiplies it with the users input.
					</p>
					<p>
						While it only takes a fraction of a second to download the xml data upon request, I implemented multithreading so the application does not slow down at any point for the user.

					<h2>Raycasting Coding Adventure</h2>
					<span class="project-subtitle"><a href="rays.html" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> - <a href="https://github.com/collis96/Raycasting" target="_blank">Code</a></span>
					<img src="img/raycasting.PNG" class="project-img" align="left" alt="raycasting-image">
					<p>
						For this coding challenge I wanted to simulate light at a very simple level, hitting opaque wall objects and not bouncing. While not very useful, it IS nice to look at. Take a look by clicking <a href="rays.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
					<p>
					</p>
					<p>
						Computer graphics are a fascinating subject that I really want to understand at a deeper level. Working with them is incredibly rewarding when you can see the progress you are making in a visual way.

					<h2>Simple Calculator</h2>
					<span class="project-subtitle"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arcticumi.calculator&hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Download</a> - <a href="https://github.com/collis96/Calculator" target="_blank">Code</a></span>
					<img src="img/calculator-app.PNG" class="project-img" align="left" alt="calculator-app-image">
					<p>
						This application was a project I set myself as a first venture into Android development. I wanted to create a very easy-to-use calculator with accessiblity in mind. That's why I decided on a basic colour scheme and easy to press large buttons.

				<h2>Coming Soon: My Squad Builder</h2>
					<span class="project-subtitle"><a href="https://mysquadbuilder.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> - <a href="https://github.com/collis96/My-Squad-Builder" target="_blank">Code</a></span>
				<img src="img/mysquadbuilder.PNG" class="project-img" align="left" alt="mysquadbuilder-image">
				<p>
					This is a Node.JS & MySQL project which will allow users to add players to a database and view their stats while also being able to edit and/or delete players.
				</p>
				<p>
					Disclaimer: This is a work in progress and as such the <a href="https://mysquadbuilder.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> may be temperamental.

					Coming Soon: Flatspace
				</h2>
				<span class="project-subtitle"><a href="https://github.com/collis96/Flatspace" target="_blank">Code</a></span>
				<img src="img/flatspace.PNG" class="project-img" align="left" alt="flatspace-image">
				<p>
					The aim of this project is to simulate celestial mechanics in a 2-Dimensional plane. The biggest challenge for this will be to first understand the
					underlying physics of orbital mechanics and then translating that into code. My first intuition is going to be correctly calculating the
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements" target="_blank"> orbital elements</a> from there I should be able to plot the orbit of non-static objects.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are many ideas of where I could take this project, when successfully implemented in 2-Dimensions it should be easy enough to implement a 3D web based version.
					The <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank"> Three.js</a> library will be helpful to make easy work of the WebGL needed.
